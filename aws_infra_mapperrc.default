ec2_instance:
# You can use any Aws::EC2::Types::Instance attributes here (typically instance_id, state, ...)
# Additionally you can use any instance tag using the form tag_TAGKEY (where TAGKEY is the key of
# the tag). tag_TAGKEY will be replaced by the value of the tag
  ec2_instance_label: "{{instance_id}}"
  # e.g. ec2_instance_label: "{{tag_Name}}"
