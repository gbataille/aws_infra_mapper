# AwsInfraMapper

## Testing

### Rspec

Nothing special, you know what to do :D

### Moto

_(Optional: without moto, some tests are simply skipped)_

Some tests are actually testing the AWS interface. To do so, it uses moto which is a local server
that mocks the AWS API.

See [here](https://github.com/spulec/moto) to install it.
